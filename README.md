Very quickly written sorta-Jeopardy-ish thing in Vue.

# Quickly...

I wrote this very quickly for an English camp (English and Fun Camp, put on by the great folks at [ECE Thailand](https://www.facebook.com/ECEThailand)) 
where I taught as a volenteer. The game is populated with social media and other internet references, but it is driven by a json file, so 
that can be changed easily enough.

It supports any number of teams, and is very easy to use.

The game was a hit! But the code is quick-and-messy, so read it with your glasses off.
